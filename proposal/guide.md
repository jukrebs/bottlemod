## 4. Implementation Plan and Timeframe

An implementation plan consists of 3 major steps corresponding to 5 content-based milestones (MS1 – MS5).

### Step 1. \[Related Work\]
The identification and discussion (MS1) of relevant resources (e.g. books, papers, software).

### Step 2. \[Scientific and Technical Contribution\]
The design (MS2) and implementation (MS3) of relevant algorithms and system components in a prototype.

### Step 3. \[Demonstration of the Effectiveness and Efficiency of the Proposed Solution\]
The evaluation of the proposed solution via experiments (MS4) and/or analysis and the discussion and the interpretation of the findings (MS5).

**Instructions.** The implementation plan (above) has been mapped to a representative timeframe table depicted below, which includes five content-based milestones, their respective tasks, plus two finalization milestones. Adapt this table for your topic, and refine the tasks as needed. For each milestone, fill in the dates and describe the deliverables.  
**Note:** During the execution of the thesis, after each milestone, present the respective deliverable(s) to your advisor(s), in order to obtain their feedback. **[about ½ page]**
